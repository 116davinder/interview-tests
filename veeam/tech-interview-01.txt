Welcome to CloudCompany! We've developed a world-class server that can respond "Hello World" to authenticated users when a client makes a GET request. We think the whole world should have access to this, but, unfortunately, lack the resources to deploy this.
From our understanding we want to use an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool to build out our infrastructure in some cloud provider, but we're not sure which one on both accounts. Could you walk us through which cloud provider and IaC tool you'd use and draw out the deployment strategy?
