# Hackathon Task - Setup LAMP Stack with phpMyAdmin

There are 3 parts in this task.

1.	Using any configuration management tool (puppet and chefdk are already installed in the environment), install and configure `Apache`, `MySQL` (or `MariaDB`) and php locally.

2.	Using the same configuration management tool, install phpMyAdmin and configure Apache to make it available for use.


3.	Harden the security for `Apache`, `MySQL` and `phpMyAdmin` and document the steps with reason for each change made to harden the setup.


We encourage candidates to discuss the task and ask questions during the test. The C9 chat window in the bottom right can be used to communicate with our team.
